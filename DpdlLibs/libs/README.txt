Dpdl Scripting Lib V1.0

This folder contains some auxiliary library files and class references needed to run
Dpdl scripts.

The DEMO release version of Dpdl does NOT allow to delete or modify the class file reference file:

The REGISTERED release version can apply changes to classes.txt in order to enable class loading
of external libraries
