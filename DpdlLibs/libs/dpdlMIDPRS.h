#
# This library is implemented with Dpdl scripting and comes with the standard core DpdlEngine.
# It contains system abstraction functions and internal variables.
#
# Filename: dpdlMIDPRS.h
# This library provides functions for accessing MIDP and J2ME/JavaME RecordStore functions
#
# NOTE:In order to reuse Dpdl scripts in the same way on platforms different than J2ME or MIDP, include dpdlRS.h instead,
# so you don't need to change anything.
