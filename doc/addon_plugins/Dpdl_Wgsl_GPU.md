## Dpdl 'Wgsl' plug-in (on GPU)

The dedicated dpdl language plug-in 'Wgsl' can execute WGSL (WebGPU Shading Language) compute code, which is executed on GPU and complies to the [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) specification, directly embedded within Dpdl code.

The WGSL language can be used to programmatically execute workloads of graphic compute pipelines as well as compute algorithms directly on GPUs and GPGPU's

The 'Wgsl' dpdl language plug-in supports all major GPU platforms such as Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and others. The WGSL code embedded with this plug-in can run on a wide variety of laptops, workstations, mobile devices and any hardware with Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX support.
