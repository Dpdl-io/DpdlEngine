## DpdlAINerd - a Dpdl language plug-in for generative code


'DpdlAINerd' is a dedicated Dpdl language plug-in for generative code.

The plug-in provided allows to generate via a configured AI engine embedded code sections in various programming languages which can than be executed as embedded code within Dpdl. More generally the plug-in allows to generate also content used in the code execution.

This enables to write code faster in the prototyping phase and allows also to generate data on the fly needed for development and testing.

The 'DpdlAINerd' Dpdl language plug-in can be executed within Dpdl via the keyword **`>>ai`**

The following example shows how to sort a list of numbers using the clojure programming language:
```python
println("Dpdl example with generative AI code...")

string numbers_param = "1 43 63 634 64 21 3 6 346 34 1000 23 55"
dpdl_stack_push("dpdlbuf_result", numbers_param)

>>ai
	>>clj
	Write a functions with clojure programming language named 'dpdl_main', with namespace 'dpdl', accepts as parameter a java array
	of objects, take the first string containing numbers, sorts the numbers and returns a string with the numbers sorted.
<<

int exit_code = dpdl_exit_code()
println("embedded ai generated exit code: " + exit_code)
```

The Dpdl code above generates the following Dpdl source file, which in this case was ready to execute right away giving No errors:
```python
println("Dpdl example with generative AI code...")

string numbers_param = "1 43 63 634 64 21 3 6 346 34 1000 23 55"
dpdl_stack_push("dpdlbuf_result", numbers_param)

>>clj
(ns dpdl)

(defn dpdl_main [^objects objs]
  (let [nums-str (first objs)
        nums (map #(Long/parseLong %) (clojure.string/split nums-str #"\s+"))]
    (->> nums
         sort
         (map str)
         (clojure.string/join " "))))
<<

int exit_code = dpdl_exit_code()
println("embedded ai generated exit code: " + exit_code)
```

### Supported AI engines

Currently 'DpdlAINerd' supports the following AI engines:

- OpenAI (Model: gpt-3.5-turbo)
- Google Vertex AI (supported soon)
- *support for more engines will follow


The engine used can be configured via the 'DpdlPlugins.ini' configuration file, along with the appropriate access key 

DpdlPlugins.ini sample:
```
[DpdlAINerd]
DAN_ENGINE=openai
DAN_API_KEY=put_your_api_key_here
```

### How to call

The code can be generated by providing the '@gen' parameter to the code execution.

The DpdlEngine will generate a new file in the same directory with the '_gen' suffix.

Example:
```
java --add-opens java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.http=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/sun.net.www.protocol.https=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED -jar DpdlEngine_V1.0_release.jar -load ai/dpdlAITest.h @gen
```


### Current status

DpdlAINerd is in a very first stage of development with huge improvements and features foreseen in near future. 

Stand-by for the coming innovation we're bringing to Dpdl with generative code.


### Next integrations

- Image generation for test data
- Speech to Code generation
