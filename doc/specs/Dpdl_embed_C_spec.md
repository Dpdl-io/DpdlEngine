The dpdl embedded C code can be executed in 2 different modes, either 'interpreted' or 'compiled'.

Each of the execution modes have some characteristics that may fit one case  

The code is executed via a native Dpdl plug-in library that has a very small footprint (278 Kb) and therefore is applicable also on small embedded systems.

## Modes of execution

C code can be executed in 2 different modes:

1) **interpreted** C code (Mode 1) --> <ins>minimal subset of C90</ins>
2) **compiled** C code (Mode 2) --> compiled in memory at runtime, <ins>ANSI C99</ins>


## Mode 1 (interpreted)


When executing C code with this mode, the Dpdl runtime already **includes all basic C libraries and headers** and language constructs to execute the code, **no additional dependencies** needed.

Custom libraries and functions can be integrated and linked via a straight forward implementation configuration approach.

**Features:**

Easy integration of custom extensions. No compile time overhead, minimal, but includes all basic C libraries and headers, no dependencies, POSIX compliant.

**Minimal embedded C library documentation, for Mode (1):**

[Dpdl_embedded_C_libs.md](https://github.com/Dpdl-io/DpdlEngine/blob/main/doc/Dpdl_embedded_C_libs.md)

* The embedded C code for mode (1) may, or may not include a 'main(..)' function. If the main function is defined, parameters which are pushed to the Dpdl stack via the 'dpdl_stack_push(..)' function are passed as parameters to the main function in the C code


### Example execution Mode (1) (without main(..) function):

```python
println("my Dpdl script embeds some C code")

>>c
#include <stdio.h>

printf("Hello C from Dpdl\n");
<<
```


### Example execution Mode (1) (with main(..) function) -> function accepting parameters, and writing a result to the Dpdl stack:

```python
println("my Dpdl script embeds some C code")

dpdl_stack_push("dpdlbuf_myresult", "param1", "param 2", 23)
>>c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <dpdl.h>

int dpdl_main(int argc, char **argv){
	printf("Hello C from Dpdl!\n");
	printf("\n");
	printf("num params: %d\n", argc);
	int cnt;
    for (cnt = 0; cnt < argc; cnt++){
        printf("	param %d: %s\n", cnt, argv[cnt]);
    }
    dpdl_stack_buf_put("my result from C");
    return 0;
}
<<
int exit_code = dpdl_exit_code()
println("finished executing embedded C code: " + exit_code)

string buf = dpdl_stack_buf_get("dpdlbuf_myresult")
println("response buffer: " + buf)
```


## Mode 2 (compiled)

This mode can be activated via the dpdl stack option '**dpdl:compile**'.

This operation mode supports ANSI C (ISO C99 standard) and many GNUC extensions including inline assembly on x86 systems. Complex and imaginary numbers are currently not available.

The 'dpdl:compile' option is available for the following platforms: **Linux (x86_64) MacOS (arm64), Raspberry (armv7l), Windows 64**.

The embedded C compiler included is built upon the super fast <ins>**Fabrice Bellard's TCC**</ins>.

The compiler is self-relying and does not require an external assembler or linker.

The required header files and libraries by default are searched in the default paths (i.e. /usr/local ) but alternative paths can be supplied as option parameters.

For this mode the DpdlEngine release by default includes just a basic set of include headers and libraries that are located in the folder './lib/native/$platform/include'. Additional dependencies can be added via the options 'dpdl:-I' and 'dpdl:-L' option settings.

* The embedded C code for mode (2) must contain a '**dpdl_main(..)**' function which serves as entry point for the execution

* parameters which are pushed to the Dpdl stack via the 'dpdl_stack_push(..)' function are passed as parameters to the main function in the C code


### Example execution Mode (2), compiled in memory at runtime

For the dynamic on-the-fly compilation of the embedded C code (mode 2), the option '**dpdl:compile**' and eventually further compiler
parameters needs to be pushed on the dpdl stack. The compilation is performed in memory and per default does not generate
any output files. Output files may be generated by activating a specific option.

Using this approach is useful for achieving optimal speed of the executing C code.
This operation mode supports ANSI C (full ISO C99 standard) and many GNUC extensions including inline assembly (complex and imaginary numbers are currently excluded)

The default location for include header files is './lib/native/$platform/include', and for library files (static and dynamic) in './lib/native/$platform'

Custom include and library settings can be provided with the options 'dpdl:-I$INC_DIR' and 'dpdl:-L$LIB_DIR' pushed on the dpdl stack.

```python
# main
println("this Dpdl example shows how C code can be dynamically compiled (in memory at runtime) and executed on Dpdl")

# we instuct the Dpdl runtime to compile the C code
dpdl_stack_push("dpdlbuf_myresult", "dpdl:compile", "dpdl:-I./DpdlLibs/C", "var1")

>>c
#include <stdio.h>

extern void dpdl_stack_buf_put(char *buf);
	
static inline void * my_memcpy(void * to, const void * from, size_t n)
{
// NOTE: inline assembly is avaiable only on i386 and X86_64 platforms, but compiles also on ARM
int d0, d1, d2;
__asm__ __volatile__(
        "rep ; movsl\n\t"
        "testb $2,%b4\n\t"
        "je 1f\n\t"
        "movsw\n"
        "1:\ttestb $1,%b4\n\t"
        "je 2f\n\t"
        "movsb\n"
        "2:"
        : "=&c" (d0), "=&D" (d1), "=&S" (d2)
        :"0" (n/4), "q" (n),"1" ((long) to),"2" ((long) from)
        : "memory");
		return (to);
}

int dpdl_main(int argc, char **argv){
	printf("This code will be compiled before it's being executed...\n");
	int i = 0;
	while(i < 30000000){
		printf("The Future is NOW ^ %d \n", i);
		i++;
	}

	char *str_src = "MEGA source";
	char str_dest[256];
	//my_memcpy(str_dest, str_src, strlen(str_src));
	//printf("copied str: %s\n", str_dest);
	dpdl_stack_buf_put(str_src);
	return 0;
}
<<
int exit_code = dpdl_exit_code()
println("embedded C compiled and run with exit code: " + exit_code)

string buf = dpdl_stack_buf_get("dpdlbuf_myresult")
println("result: " + buf)
```

# Documentation

## C libraries included (interpreted Mode 1)

This is the documentation of the C library available when executing embedded C code with <ins>interpreted</ins> **Mode (1)** 

[Dpdl_embedded_C_libs.md](https://github.com/Dpdl-io/DpdlEngine/blob/main/doc/Dpdl_embedded_C_libs.md)


## embedded C compiler (compiled Mode 2)

### Library and include paths

Even though the embedded C compiler Dpdl language plug-in comes with a minimal set of header files located in '**./lib/native/$platform/include**', by default the Dpdl language plug-in searches for 'include' and 'lib' files in the following paths:

**Linux/Unix:**

```
/usr/include
/usr/lib
```

**MacOS:**

example:

```
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX13.3.sdk/usr/include/
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib/
```

**Windows:**

```
MinGW or equivalent installation 'include' and 'lib' folders
```

Additional include and library paths can be set directly via a dpdl stack option setting (see below)


### Configuration

The Dpdl runtime can be parameterized by pushing the corresponding option settings onto the Dpdl stack via the 
function **`dpdl_stack_push(..)`**. The options need to be prefixed with 'dpdl:'


For the embedding of C code the following option settings are available:


#### Option settings

**`dpdl:compile`**

Instructs the Dpdl runtime to compile in memory the embedded C code before executing it (execution Mode 2)

**`dpdl:-vv`**

prints include file list. To show also include tries use the flag '-vvv' instead

**`dpdl:-F$File`**

Adds the specified file to the compile set

Note: The unregistered version of 'DpdlEngine lite' allows this option to be used only once within a given execution section

**`dpdl:-A$Dir`**

Adds the all the files contained in the specified directory to the compile set

Note: This option is enabled only in the full registered version of 'DpdlEngine lite'

**`dpdl:-I$Path`**

Adds the specified include path reachable by the compiler

Note: The directlry "./lib/native/$Platform/include" is already added per default to the include path where basic includes are present

**`dpdl:-L$Path`**

Adds the specified library path reachable by the compiler and linker

**`dpdl:-l$lib`**

Adds the specified library for the linker

**`dpdl:-D$sym[=val]`**

Defines the preprocessor symbol '$sym' and optionally an associated value. If 'val' in not defined, it defaults to 1.

Function like macros can also be defined, e.g **`dpdl:-DF(a)=a+1`**

**`dpdl:$option`**

Any other option supported by the compiler can be passed using the prefix 'dpdl:'


**Example:**

```c
println("this Dpdl demo shows how C code can be dynamically compiled (in memory at runtime) within Dpdl")

dpdl_stack_push("dpdl:compile", "dpdl:-Dtestvar=999", "dpdl:-DtestF(a)=a+23", "dpdl:-I./DpdlLibs/C", "dpdl:-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX13.3.sdk/usr/include", "dpdl:-L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX13.3.sdk/usr/lib")

>>c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<pthread.h>

pthread_t tids[3];
int numbers[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
int num[2]={0,0};

void* firstThread(void* arg){
	int ans = 0;
	for(int i=0;i<500;i++){
		ans += numbers[i];
		printf("1: %d\n", i);
	}
	printf("Result Thread 1: %d\n",ans);
	num[0] = ans;
}


void* secondThread(void* arg){
	int ans = 0;
	for(int i=5;i<1000;i++){
		ans+=numbers[i];
		printf("2: %d\n", i);
	}
	printf("Result Thread 2: %d\n",ans);
	num[1]=ans;
}

void* sum(void* arg){
	pthread_join(tids[0],NULL);
	pthread_join(tids[1],NULL);
	int ans = num[0]+num[1];
	printf("Result Final: %d\n",ans);
}

int dpdl_main(int param){

	printf("Dpdl embedded C Test: %d %d\n", testvar, testF(0));
	
	pthread_create(&tids[0],NULL,firstThread,(void*)NULL);
	pthread_create(&tids[1],NULL,secondThread,(void*)NULL);
	pthread_create(&tids[2],NULL,sum,(void*)NULL);
	pthread_join(tids[2],NULL);
	printf("finished\n");

	return 1;
}
<<
int exit_code = dpdl_exit_code()

println("embedded C code compiled and run with exit code: " + exit_code)
```
