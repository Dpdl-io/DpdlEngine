### Dpdl tutorial #1: Loading and accessing 'Wasm' compiled code within Dpdl

This tutorial shows how to compile a rust library to 'Wasm' target, load the resulting wasm code into the runtime and make function calls to wasm module functions from Dpdl code. It also shows how you can embed WAT code that is compiled in memory at runtime along with the compiled rust library so that exported function calls can be performed from Dpdl.
